# GGP - github governance policy

## Problem statement 
Large enterprise customers are always requiring more governance over their GitHub environment. Examples:
1. A bank want their webhooks to be only sending data to certain places (URLs) and we don't yet have any way to check if their teams are doing the wrong thing
1. A large multi-national enterprise wants to ensure the GitHub Apps installed within each GitHub Organization are within a certain set of approved ones
1. It is possible for the creator of a new organization to forget to enable settings to enforce SAML single sign-on (SSO) and 2FA which adds risk should employee GitHub credentials be stolen
